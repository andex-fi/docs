# Andex Documentation

This web application contains all documentation for Andex products. It is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.


# Project Layout

### Andex documentation is broken down into four sections:
- Concepts - General Andex information or concepts useful for using Andex products, such as *Liquidity* and *Fees*
- Contracts - Andex smart contracts
- SDKs - Andex integrations such as the *andex-sdk* and the *Swap Widget*

### Each item in a section should include the following:
- *Overview*
- *Guides*
- *Technical Reference*
