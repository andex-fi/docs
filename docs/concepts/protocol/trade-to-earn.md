Andex Protocol introduces a new incentivization model that enables users to earn rewards while they trade. On Other AMMs only liquidity providers earn fees from
trades. We have taken a cue from Looksrare's incentivized trading model and build an AMM that allows both Liquidity providers and average traders to earn from using our protocol.

## How does it work?

Our trade mining mechanism is designed based on a TST (Trade Shares Token). Once users trade in incentivized trading pairs, TST will be minted to their account according to the amount traded and pool weight of the given pair, These TST tokens are not valuable and can be considered as receipt tokens which are only evidence of trade. However, users can redeem the Shares for ANDX Tokens. If the user does not redeem the trade shares, TST balance will always be there and will increase with each incentivized trade until user chooses to redeem the trade shares for ANDX, after which the TST balance will reset to zero.
