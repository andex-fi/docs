## Protocol, Interface, Labs

To begin, we should make clear the distinctions between the different areas of "Andex", some of which may confuse new users.

- **Gather Labs**: The company which developed the Andex protocol, along with the web interface.
- **The Andex Protocol**: A suite of persistent, smart contracts that together create an automated market maker, a protocol that facilitates peer-to-peer market making and swapping of tokens on Venom Chain.
- **The Andex Interface**: A web interface that allows for easy interaction with the Andex protocol. The interface is only one of many ways one may interact with the Andex protocol.
- **Andex Governance**: A governance system for governing the Andex Protocol, enabled by the ANDX token.
